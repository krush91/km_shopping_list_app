Flask Application with CI_CD pipeline and Docker Swarm

This project was created a test web application which was written in Python Flask (and Jinja templates). It connected to a MySQL database and demonstrated full CRUD functionality.  

The application was integrated with a CI/CD pipeline in Jenkins that automatically tested, built and deployed the application using Docker containers (and Docker Swarm) via Webhooks.
